# About
## This is me üíÅ

#### Hello everyone,my name is RealTapeL. I'm a computer student at a university. I have been learning c language and robot programming since I was very young. Currently, my research directions are visual tasks, data processing and large models. My hobbies are embedded systems, such as Raspberry PI and Jetson. I like to automate my life. I like buying good-looking products, clothes and food. Suffering from congenital heart disease and severe depression, sometimes one may not be optimistic. Hopefully, it will get better in the future.
